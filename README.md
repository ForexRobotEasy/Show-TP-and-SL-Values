# Show TP and SL Values

## Overview
The 'Show TP and SL Values' is a trading robot that is designed to identify candlestick patterns and calculate the corresponding take profit (TP) and stop loss (SL) values. It seamlessly integrates with the Candle Stick Patterns Finder tool for efficient functioning. The code is compatible with both MT4 and MT5 platforms.

## Functionality
The program consists of three main functions: `IdentifyCandlestickPatterns()`, `CalculateTakeProfit()`, and `CalculateStopLoss()`. These functions work together to identify candlestick patterns, calculate the TP and SL values for each pattern, and display the results.

### Function: IdentifyCandlestickPatterns()
This function is responsible for identifying various candlestick patterns. The actual code for pattern identification should be added within this function.

### Function: CalculateTakeProfit()
This function calculates the TP value for each identified candlestick pattern. The code for TP calculation should be added within this function. The calculated TP value is then returned as a `double` value.

### Function: CalculateStopLoss()
Similar to the `CalculateTakeProfit()` function, this function calculates the SL value for each identified candlestick pattern. The code for SL calculation should be added within this function. The calculated SL value is then returned as a `double` value.

### Main Entry Point: OnStart()
The `OnStart()` function is the main entry point of the program. It executes the following steps:
1. Calls the `IdentifyCandlestickPatterns()` function to identify candlestick patterns.
2. Calls the `CalculateTakeProfit()` function to calculate the TP value.
3. Calls the `CalculateStopLoss()` function to calculate the SL value.
4. Prints the TP and SL values using the `Print()` function.
5. Executes further trading logic and actions (not included in the provided code).
6. Ends the program.
